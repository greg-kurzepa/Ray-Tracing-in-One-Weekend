# Ray Tracer

I followed the Ray Tracing in one Weekend tutorial at <https://raytracing.github.io/>.

Following along with the explanations, I implemented my own version of the code.
I also used my png writer library to export the result. 

To compile, run `g++ -Wall -o out *.cpp` in the project's root directory.
